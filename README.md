# Bank-Marketing-Data-Analysis

## Requirements
* Python 2.7 
* Numpy >= 1.14.2
* Matplotlib >= 2.2.0
* Pandas >= 0.22.0
* Scikit-Learn >= 0.19.1

## Description

1. Bank Marketing dataset is collected from direct marketing campaign of a bank institution from Portuguese. 

2.  Marketing campaign can be understood as phone calls to the clients to convince them accept to make a term deposit with their bank. 
 
3. After each call, they are being noted as to no - being the client did not make a deposit and yes - being the client on call accepted to make a deposit. 

4. The purpose of this project is to predict if the client on call would accept to make a term deposit or not based on the information of the clients. 

5. The Bank Marketing Data Set considered for this project is a small portion (10%) of the entire available data set. The data set has about 4119 rows of data with 19 features and 1 column of Class information. 

6. The main issues of the dataset are: 

    * Preprocessing required to fill unknown values in the dataset 
    
    * Preprocessing required to decide on usage of categorical data along with continuous data  
    
    * The data is class imbalanced (Number of class 1 (yes) is very low when compared to the number of Class 0 (no)) 
    
7. Data Analysis Work done for this analysis include:  

    * Understanding of features 
    
    * Preprocessing of features  
    
    * K-Nearest Neighbor Classifier 
     
    * Logistic Regression 
    
    * Naïve Bayes 
    
    * SVM  
    
    * Perceptrons 
    
    * Random Forest Classifier  
    
    * Dimensionality Reduction
